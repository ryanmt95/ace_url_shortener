# ace_url_shortener

This app is a URL shortener that works similarly to tinyURL. The user inputs a URL and a short URL is provided by the application. Entering the short URL on the browser will redirect the user to the original URL page. 

The application is deployed on Heroku under the following urls: 

Client - https://ace-shrt.herokuapp.com/

Server - https://ace-shrt-server.herokuapp.com/

MongoDB is used for persistence of the shortened URLS across system reboots. A non-relational database was used as MongoDB offers a free service.
